## Ideas 

- FOR (target customer)
- WHO (statement of the need or opportunity)
- The (PRODUCT NAME) is a (product category)
- THAT (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
- UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative)
- OUR PRODUCT (statement of primary differentiation)

---

- Point of the course is to somehow imitate the process of software development
- For everyone, but it would be nice to target news sites, forecast predictions and such, which people already look at while looking for weather
  - service for other services to be used in this format
  - API for them to use
- Another target might be fire brigade to know how many people should be ready and such
  - pretty close times
- Insurence companies - high fire risk -> higher insurence
  - longer periods than average users
- What is better with our app?
  - The model can tell in detail in which city/part of city, what the flashover time is (after rain it needs to check humidity and such)
- We can pretty much use anything for development, it should simulate the work process of company so any libraries and such is okay
